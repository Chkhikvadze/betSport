What is bets-sport?
==================

A bets-sport (also referred to as betting arbitrage, miraclebet or arb) is a set of bets on a certain event that guarantees a profit of no less than the total amount of bets made,
regardless of the result of the event.

Simply put, it’s a situation where the player gets a profit regardless of the situation – or at least does not lose anything.
A player may want to set bets in a way that will produce a better result under specific conditions.
